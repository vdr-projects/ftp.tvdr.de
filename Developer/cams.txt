Current status of CAM support in VDR
====================================

This file describes the steps you should perform if your CAM doesn't work with
VDR right away.

First you should enable debug output by doing the following:

- Remove the comments in front of the line
  //#define DEBUG_CA_DESCRIPTORS 1
  in pat.c.
- Set the variables DumpTPDUDataTransfer and DebugProtocol in ci.c to 'true'.
- Compile and run VDR.
- Observe the debug output on the console and in /var/log/messages (be sure you run
  VDR with option '-l3', which is the maximum logging level; this is the default, so
  if you haven't used any '-l' option ao far you should be fine).

Now check the output at the console (where you started VDR) and in /var/log/messages
and verify each of the following steps:

1 Reset
  -----

  There is no apparent way of telling whether the ioctl(CA_RESET) has actually
  had any effect. The only thing we can check is the return value of the ioctl().
  If there is an error it will be reported in /var/log/messages as "vdr: ERROR: ...".
  If all goes well you should see

  Resetting slot 0...ok.
  Resetting slot 1...ok!

2 CA_CI_MODULE_PRESENT, CA_CI_MODULE_READY
  ----------------------------------------

  Tune to an encrypted channel.
  After a few seconds you should see

  Module ready in slot 0
  Module ready in slot 1

  (depending on which slots actually contain a CAM).

3 Response to T_CREATE_TC
  -----------------------

  The initial connection should result in the following output at the console:

  --> 00 01 82 01 01
  <-- 00 01 83 01 01 80 02 01 00

  (the last '00' may also be '80'). If the second line doesn't appear, the CAM is
  not responding.

4 Creating sessions
  -----------------

  There should be several sequences that create "sessions", like

  OpenSession 00010041
  New Resource Manager (session id 1)
  ...
  OpenSession 00020041
  New Aplication Information (session id 2)
  ...
  OpenSession 00030041
  New Conditional Access Support (session id 3)
  ...

5 Identifying the CAM
  -------------------

  You should see a line like this in /var/log/messages:

  CAM: Irdeto, 01, 1702, 1702

6 Menu
  ----

  Go into VDR's "Setup/CICAM" menu and press the red button on the entry for the
  DVB card that contains the CAM. You should see the lines

  2: ==> Enter Menu
  --> 00 01 A0 09 01 90 02 00 02 9F 80 22 00
  <-- 00 01 80 02 01 00

  at the console, soon followed by

  OpenSession 00400041
  New MMI (session id 5)
  ...
  5: <== Display Control
  5: ==> Display Reply
  ...
  <-- 00 01 A0 82 00 80 01 90 02 00 05 9F 88 09 77 05 9F 88 03 12...

  The last line represents the actual menu contents. After this you should see
  the CAM menu on the OSD.

7 Gathering CA descriptors
  ------------------------

  When you switch to an encrypted channel, there should be lines like this in
  the /var/log/messages file:

  CAM: 88C0 11797    8 09 06 17 02 F0 0C 00 0C

  If no such line is logged, extracting the CA descriptors from the data stream
  doesn't work.

8 Sending AOT_CA_PMT
  ------------------

  Every time you switch to an encrypted channel you should see a sequence like this
  at the console:

  --> 00 01 A0 3C 01 90 02 00 03 9F 80 32 33 03 00 0A 00 00 19 01 09 06 17 02 F0 0A
  00 0A 09 06 17 22 F5 0A 00 0A 09 06 17 62 F8 0A 00 0A 00 01 FF 00 00 00 02 00
  00 00 00 02 01 00 00 00 02 03 00 00
  <-- 00 01 80 02 01 00

9 Decrypting
  ----------

  Well, this one is easy: if you see a picture and hear the sound of an encrypted
  channel, your CAM is actually decrypting :-)

Following is a table, listing the currently known status of various CAMs.
The numbers (1...9) correspond to the steps listed above. If you have a CAM that
is not listed here, or find that the results listed here are wrong, please set up
an entry like the ones below and send it to kls@cadsoft.de.

The left column lists the type of CAM, and below it the revision of the CI adapter
(that's the board that gets connected to the DVB card with a flat ribbon cable,
and into which you plug the CAM). Here 'PCI' means that it's a card that is mounted
like a normal PCI card would be, and '3.5"' means it goes into a 3.5" drive bay.

The "Old" column tells whether this CAM worked with the old firmware.
The "Mult" column tells whether everything works as expected with multiple CAMs
(i.e. both slots holding a CAM module).
