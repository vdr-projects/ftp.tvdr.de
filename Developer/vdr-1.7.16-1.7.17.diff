+- Made 'dist' target dependent on up to date *.po (thanks to Ville Skytt‰).
+- Added Language and fixed Language-Team header of *.po (thanks to Ville Skytt‰).
+- Updated the Lithuanian OSD texts (thanks to Valdemaras Pipiras).
+- Fixed detecting frames on channels that broadcast with 50 or 60 fps.
+  This avoids artifacts during fast forward/rewind when replaying recordings from such
+  channels. To fix the index of existing recordings from such channels, just delete the
+  'index' file of the recording and VDR will generate a new one the next time you play it.
+  You should also change the line "F 25" to "F 50" in the 'info' file of that recording.
+- Added support for "registration descriptor" to 'libsi' and using it in pat.c (thanks
+  to Rolf Ahrenberg).
+- Fixed unjustified log entries about changed channel pids (reported by Derek Kelly).
+- Added an include of VDR's 'Make.global' to libsi's Makefile (thanks to Rolf
+  Ahrenberg).
+- Removed displaying the "contents" information from the "Classic VDR" and
+  "ST:TNG Panels" skins, because it is often wrong and nothing but irritating.
+- Added typecasts to avoid gcc 4.5 warnings in switch statements on eKeys
+  variables where additional 'k_...' flags are used.
+- Fixed inclusion of <stdarg.h> (thanks to Henning Heinold).
+- Changed "frame duration" to "frame rate" in vdr.5 (reported by Tobias Grimm).
+- Removing a cRemote from the Remotes list in case its initialization failed (thanks
+  to Dominik Strasser).
+- Added LDFLAGS to the linker calls in the Makefiles (thanks to Joerg Bornkessel and
+  Paul Menzel).
+- Now updating the 'frames per second' data in the list of recordings when a new
+  recording is started that has a frame rate other than the default.
+- The include path to the freetype2 header files is now retrieved via a call to
+  'pkg-config --cflags freetype2' (suggested by Andreas Oberritter).
+- The OSD now has full TrueColor support. There can be several "pixmaps" that can
+  be overlayed with alpha blending. All existing skins should work out of the box
+  with the TrueColor OSD - the only exception being cOsd::GetBitmap(). Since the
+  TrueColor OSD doesn't use bitmaps, this function will return a dummy bitmap, which
+  may not be what the plugin expects. As long as this bitmap is only used for setting
+  the palette, there is no problem. However, any other operations on this bitmap will
+  have no effect. See the description of the cPixmap functions in osd.h for details
+  about the new functionalities.
+  The "ST:TNG Panels" skin has been enhanced to automatically use the TrueColor OSD
+  if available.
+  The "osddemo" plugin has been extended to show some of the possibilities of the
+  TrueColor OSD if it is run on a system that actually provides TrueColor support.
+  Thanks to Reinhard Nissl for some valuable input, help with debugging, and an
+  implementation of the AlphaBlend() function.
+- Updated the Slovakian language texts (thanks to Milan Hrala).
+- Added Serbian language texts (thanks to Milan Cvijanovic).
+- Fixed reallocating memory in the "pictures" plugin (reported by Paul Menzel, with
+  input from Oliver Endriss).
+- Fixed reallocating memory in cTsToPes::PutTs() (suggested by Oliver Endriss).
+- Now checking the result of all realloc() calls.
+- Fixed setting up the 'Recordings' menu in case there are several recordings
+  with exactly the same name (reported by Marcus Hilbrich).
+- Setting the audio type of language descriptors to 0x00 in the PAT/PMT generator
+  (thanks to Anssi Hannula).
+- Changed the compiler optimization flag to -O3, which gives quite a performance
+  boost in the AlphaBlend() function.
+- While replaying, the editing marks are now updated every 10 seconds (based on a
+  patch from Manuel Reimer).
+- Now reducing the thread and I/O priority cCuttingThread::Action() to make the
+  foreground process more responsive (suggested by Frank Neumann).
+- Removed checking for minimum line length of 21 characters in the LIRC receiver code
+  (reported by Gerald Dachs).
+- Updated the Romanian OSD texts (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
+- Now storing the original display size when handling DVB subtitles (thanks to
+  Reinhard Nissl).
+- The original display size of subtitles is now used to scale them properly when
+  displaying them on an HD OSD.

 It's a very primitive game that opens a small window in which the
 user can draw lines with the Up, Down, Left and Right buttons.
 The color buttons are used to switch color.
+
+On a VDR system with TrueColor support it displays some of the
+possibilities available with the TrueColor OSD. Once the "Animation"
+pixmap is displayed, it can be moved around with the Up, Down, Left
+and Right buttons. The Red button turns off the "Tiled Pixmaps"
+display, and the Green button toggles the color display.
+
 Press Ok to close the window.
